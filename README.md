## 1. Installation: <a name="installation"></a>

No additional libraries to run the code beyond the anaconda distribution of python. Python version 3 should be used to run the code.


## 2. Project Motivation: <a name="motavation"></a>

In this project, I will try to answer the following Questions given the dataset in hand:

1. Can we predict kidney disease illness given a limited and unclean sample of patines information?
2. What are the best features that can help predict Chronic kidney disease?

## 3. File Descriptions: <a name="f_descriptions"></a>

There is one notebook included here to demonstrate the work done to answer the above questions. Markdown cells were used to guide you through the steps.

## 4. Results: <a name="Result"></a>

The main findings can be found in this [post](https://medium.com/@hiba.fallatah/analysis-and-prediction-for-the-chronic-kidney-disease-dataset-57133744fca7?source=friends_link&sk=cbe40042728c530c420ddb7d3a2e33c8).

The data has been collected and published by I. Jerlin Rubini a research scholar and Dr. P. Soundarapandian a Senior Consultant Nephrologist in July 2015. The data has been published at UCI machine Learning and Repository websit and you can find it [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Chronic_Kidney_Disease#).
